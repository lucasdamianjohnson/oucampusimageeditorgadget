OU Campus MTU Image Editor Gadget
I was tasked with remaking the image cropping gadget for OU campus. 
I had to reconfigure it to match MTUs changing image sizes standards. So, not all of this code is mine. 
This might be useful to you if you are a user of OU Campus. But this was also very speicfically desinged for MTUs needs. 

The gadget allows a user to crop images sizes that we pre-determine. 
This allows all images on the site to have desired aspect ratios for the best cross-platform experience. 
The gadget also stores previous crops in a database so new sizes can be cropped with the same selected area.
